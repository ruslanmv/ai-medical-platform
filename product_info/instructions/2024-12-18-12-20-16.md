In traditional Chinese culture, there is deep research into what is appropriate and inappropriate in life. Leaving aside feudal superstitions, many aspects are scientific. For example, clothing is very particular: spring clothes should be pleasant, summer clothes should be refreshing, autumn clothes should be elegant, and winter clothes should be bright; when meeting guests, formal attire is suitable, for long journeys, plain attire is suitable, under flowers, simple attire is suitable, and facing snow, beautiful attire is suitable. This is the philosophy and aesthetics of dressing, illustrating that the Chinese people understood very early on that clothing is artistic, cultural, and also inspirational.

Another example is the emphasis on "mutual generation and mutual restriction" in food. Medical classics record over 180 groups of food antagonisms. For instance, duck eggs and plums, snails and noodles, eel and beef liver, hairy crab and pumpkin, and so on.

Modern life is even more rich and varied, with diverse lifestyles intertwined. Tradition and modernity, local and foreign, science and backwardness, generate and restrict each other, in a process of natural selection, making things very complex. This necessitates our study of what is appropriate and inappropriate in modern life. Clothing should consider what is appropriate and inappropriate, food should emphasize balanced combinations, sleep should be conducive to health, exercise should follow rules, and so on.

Therefore, based on a synthesis of the latest research findings both domestically and internationally, I have specially compiled this book. It primarily covers clothing and accessories, diet and nutrition, sleep and accommodation, exercise and healthcare, beauty and makeup, daily necessities, social interactions, medical treatments, and what is appropriate and inappropriate for different groups of people. It is very comprehensive and systematic, with strong scientific and practical value. It is also very easy to understand and use, serving as a good teacher and helpful friend to guide modern living and create happy families for the vast readership.

## What is Acute Bronchitis?

Acute bronchitis is an acute inflammation of the bronchial mucosa, a common respiratory system disease, caused by bacterial and viral infections, physical or chemical irritants, allergic reactions, and other factors. It is more prevalent in cold seasons, with the elderly, young children, and those with weak constitutions being more susceptible. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), this disease falls under the category of "cough."

# 【Clinical Manifestations】

1. Initially, there are varying degrees of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms, such as nasal congestion, sneezing, sore throat and itchy throat, hoarseness, headache, general malaise or muscle pain, mild chills, fever, etc. Cough is not obvious at the beginning or is a mild irritative cough with no or little phlegm. After 1-2 days, the cough worsens, phlegm increases, changing from mucus to mucopurulent sputum. In severe cases, there are paroxysmal coughs or coughs throughout the day.

2. If accompanied by bronchial spasm, dyspnea and wheezing may occur.

## What is Chronic Bronchitis?

Chronic bronchitis is a chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and atrophy of the bronchial mucosa and surrounding tissues, caused by infection or non-infectious factors. Clinical symptoms are mainly cough, expectoration, and wheezing. Early symptoms are mild, mostly occurring in winter, while late symptoms worsen and may persist throughout the year. Disease progression can lead to emphysema and pulmonary heart disease. This disease is common and frequently occurring, more common in the elderly, and has a high incidence in smokers, cold regions, and heavily polluted areas. In TCM, this disease falls under the categories of "cough" and "asthma."

# 【Clinical Manifestations】

1. Recurrent cough, expectoration, or wheezing are the main manifestations. Generally, cough and expectoration are more pronounced in the morning, with white, foamy mucus sputum.

2. During acute respiratory infections, symptoms rapidly worsen, sputum volume increases, and the sputum becomes white mucus or yellow purulent.

3. With repeated attacks and disease progression, cough and expectoration persist year-round, worsening in autumn and winter, and wheezing occurs.

4. Patients have a history of recurrent cough, expectoration, or wheezing, and other conditions that can cause cough, expectoration, and wheezing, such as heart disease, lung tumors, tuberculosis, etc., are excluded.

5. Each episode lasts for at least 3 months and has occurred continuously for 2 years or more.

How to Prevent and Treat Bronchial Asthma?

Bronchial asthma is a chronic airway inflammation involving mast cells, eosinophils, and T lymphocytes, etc. In susceptible individuals, it can cause recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough, which often occur at night or in the early morning. The airways show increased responsiveness to various stimuli. The main triggering factors include specific or non-specific inhalants, infections, food, climate change, mental factors, exercise, and medications. Clinical symptoms can subside spontaneously or after treatment. This disease predominantly starts before age 12, with the highest incidence in autumn and winter, followed by spring, and the lowest in summer. Recurrent attacks can lead to chronic bronchitis, obstructive emphysema, and pulmonary heart disease. In TCM, this disease falls under the categories of "asthma" and "wheezing."

# 【Clinical Manifestations】

Typical bronchial asthma has prodromal symptoms before an attack, such as sneezing, runny nose, cough, chest tightness, etc. If not treated promptly, asthma may occur, or even orthopnea (sitting upright to breathe), dry cough or white foamy sputum, and even cyanosis. Scattered or diffuse wheezing, mainly expiratory, can be heard in both lungs.

What is Bronchiectasis?

Bronchiectasis refers to the chronic inflammation of the bronchi and surrounding lung tissues, damaging the bronchial walls, leading to bronchial dilation and deformation. Bronchiectasis is more common in children and young adults, with chronic cough, expectoration of large amounts of purulent sputum, and recurrent hemoptysis as the main symptoms. In TCM, this disease falls under the categories of "hemoptysis," "cough," and "lung carbuncle."

How is Lung Abscess Caused?

Lung abscess is a localized cavity filled with pus, produced by necrosis of lung tissue, and accompanied by inflammation of the surrounding lung tissue. The pathological process is mainly lung tissue necrosis. If lung abscess is caused by anaerobic bacteria infection, it manifests as putrid and foul-smelling sputum, while lung abscess caused by aerobic bacteria infection manifests as non-putrid sputum. However, expectoration of a large amount of purulent sputum is a significant feature. This disease mostly occurs in young and middle-aged adults, and is more common in men than women. It belongs to the TCM category of "lung carbuncle."

[Clinical Manifestations]

1. Onset is mostly sudden, with general malaise, chills, and shivering, high fever up to 39°C or above, cough with phlegm, lethargy, poor appetite, and may be accompanied by chest pain. 2. The onset lasts for about a week, and then a large amount of purulent sputum begins to be expectorated, and the daily sputum volume can be as much as hundreds of milliliters. Body temperature decreases.

3. If prolonged, developing into a chronic wasting disease, there is still cough, purulent sputum, but the sputum volume varies from time to time, and there are recurrent hemoptysis and irregular fever, emaciation, etc. In severe cases, anemia occurs.

What is Pulmonary Tuberculosis?

Pulmonary tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease of the lungs caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Patients who excrete bacteria in their sputum are called infectious pulmonary tuberculosis. Excreting patients are the source of infection, mainly transmitted through the respiratory tract by coughing out tuberculosis bacteria. It is easily infected when human immunity is low. This disease is more common in young and middle-aged adults, more common in men than women, and the incidence in the elderly has been increasing in recent years. In TCM, this disease falls under the category of "lung consumption."

How to Prevent and Treat Pneumonia?

Pneumonia refers to acute parenchymal infectious lesions including alveolar cavities and interstitial tissues. According to the etiology, it can be divided into viruses, mycoplasma, rickettsiae, bacteria, fungi, etc. The most common cause in adults is bacterial infection, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, anaerobic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, etc., while Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common infectious cause in older children and young people. The main pneumonia pathogens in infants and children are viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, etc. In TCM, this disease falls under the category of "wind-warm cough."

[Clinical Manifestations]

1. Bacterial Pneumonia: Often has upper respiratory tract infection symptoms before onset, onset is sudden, usually with high fever, local or referred chest pain, often stabbing pain in the chest, worsened with breathing and coughing. Cough, rusty-colored or a small amount of purulent sputum. Often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, general malaise, and muscle aches.

2. Viral Pneumonia: Slow onset, headache, fatigue, muscle aches, fever, cough, dry cough or a small amount of mucus sputum. Influenza virus pneumonia starts with typical flu symptoms. Within 12-36 hours, rapid breathing, progressive dyspnea, cyanosis, respiratory failure, and shock can occur. Wet rales or wheezing sounds can be heard in both lungs.

3. Mycoplasma Pneumonia: Initial symptoms are similar to influenza, with general malaise, sore throat, and dry cough. As the disease progresses, symptoms worsen, and paroxysmal coughing may occur, and the cough may produce mucus purulent or blood-streaked sputum. This disease develops slowly. Acute symptoms generally last for 1-2 weeks, and then gradually recover. However, in a few severe patients, adult respiratory distress syndrome may be caused.

4. Fungal Pneumonia: Symptoms are similar to acute pneumonia, fever, chills, cough with white mucus sputum, with a yeast-like odor, or it may be gelatinous, sometimes with hemoptysis, rapid breathing and other symptoms.

Or secretions entering the lower respiratory tract. More common in patients who have been ill in bed for a long time. If the inhaled amount is large, it can cause acute lung injury or recurrent infection distal to the obstruction. Acute cough, cough with sputum, and other symptoms similar to bacterial pneumonia appear. [Treatment Methods]

What is Viral Hepatitis?

Viral hepatitis is a common infectious disease of the liver, the pathological characteristic of which is inflammation mainly caused by hepatitis viruses leading to degeneration and necrosis of liver parenchymal cells,

A series of reflections in clinical aspects, general definite diagnosis can be determined only after doctors understand the patient's symptoms, signs and other clinical situations and examination results in aspects, comprehensive judgment can be determined. Patients have had close contact with viral hepatitis patients (especially in the acute phase) recently, such as eating, living, and living together, or frequent contact with hepatitis virus pollutants (such as blood, feces, and other secretions, etc.), have received blood transfusion, plasma injection, albumin, human blood or placenta globulin within 6 months; used non-strictly disinfected syringes for injection, vaccination or acupuncture treatment, etc.

[Clinical Manifestations]

The onset of viral hepatitis is initially fever like a cold, fatigue and weakness, which cannot be relieved by rest; loss of appetite,不想吃东西 (do not want to eat anything), aversion to greasy food, and further nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention and loose stools; liver area discomfort, distending pain, etc.

[Treatment Methods]

Early bed rest in the acute phase is important. Patients with acute hepatitis should still rest for 1-3 months after clinical symptoms disappear, and should be reviewed regularly for 1 year after returning to work.

Diet for patients in the acute phase should be light, and should eat more foods rich in vitamins B and C. In the chronic phase, adopt a combination of dynamic and static recuperation measures. High-protein intake can be appropriately increased, and excessive high-calorie diet should be avoided, and it is also not appropriate to eat too much sugar. Use some non-specific liver-protecting drugs, such as vitamin groups, drugs that promote detoxification function (such as Liver Protective Energy Powder, etc.), drugs that promote energy metabolism (inosine, coenzyme A, ATP, etc.) and drugs that promote protein synthesis (such as compound amino acid hydrolysate protein, etc.), but should not be abused. In addition, arabinosylcytosine, interferon coenzyme Q10, Yunzhi, etc. can also be selected in a timely manner. Severe hepatitis should strengthen supportive and symptomatic treatment to help patients tide over the dangerous period so that the liver can have the opportunity to repair and regenerate.

Gastrointestinal symptoms are prominent in this period, mainly manifested as loss of appetite, abdominal distention, and nausea, and there may be anorexia, aversion to greasy food

Icteric Phase Jaundice mostly starts from the sclera, followed by the face, and soon the whole body skin can see jaundice. Jaundice Cheng peak. At this time, the whole body skin and sclera are deep yellow, slightly reddish. Patients may have skin itching, and stool color becomes yellow or gray-white.

Recovery Phase Jaundice has subsided, urine color is clearer; appetite has mostly recovered, patients subjectively feel better; liver tenderness and percussion pain are reduced, and liver enlargement shrinks.

Anicteric Hepatitis The incidence is higher than icteric type, and its symptoms are similar to icteric type, but the degree is lighter, and jaundice does not occur during the course of the disease. The onset is slow, often without chills and fever; the main symptoms are loss of appetite, aversion to greasy food and nausea, general weakness, and may have abdominal distention, flatulence, and liver area pain, most of which have liver enlargement.

Caused by acute or subacute necrosis of the liver. The onset is similar to acute icteric hepatitis, and then aggravated, if not rescued in time, it may develop to liver failure in a short period of time. This disease has the following characteristics, and should be alert.

1. Systemic symptoms, such as anorexia, weakness, etc. are progressively aggravated, and there may be severe tympanites, intractable vomiting, fetor hepaticus, fever, etc.;

2. Jaundice rapidly deepens;

3. Liver can no longer be palpated (at this time liver necrosis and atrophy occur), ascites may appear rapidly;

4. More extensive bleeding tendency, such as skin ecchymosis, epistaxis, digestive tract bleeding, etc.;

5. When neurological and psychiatric symptoms occur, it is often a precursor to hepatic coma, such as personality changes, lethargy or insomnia, disorientation, impaired thinking ability, agitation, etc. [Precautions]

1. Cut off transmission routes;

? Manage sources of infection, those who have had close contact with hepatitis patients should be examined regularly; those suspected of having hepatitis shall not engage in or temporarily suspend food or nursery work and undergo medical observation for 40 days. Hepatitis patients who are engaged in food or nursery work shall not engage in their original work within 1 year after discharge from the hospital, and can resume work only after examination confirms recovery after 1 year;

Some patients have chest tightness, shortness of breath, and severe patients have visual impairment, even coma and convulsions. Physical examination shows facial and lower limb edema, kidney area percussion pain, and elevated blood pressure. Urine and renal function tests, anti-“O,” ESR, complement C3 measurement can be performed.

### (2) Treatment Methods

Bed rest within 2-4 weeks of onset, and gradually get out of bed after gross hematuria disappears, edema subsides, and blood pressure returns to normal. Pay attention to keep warm, prevent catching cold and upper respiratory tract infection.

During edema and hypertension, a low-sodium diet should be followed

3. Remove Inducing Factors: Those with infection use conventional doses of penicillin for 10-14 days. For those with abnormal urine tests for more than 3-6 months and tonsillar lesions, surgical removal should be considered.

### (3) Prevention and Nursing Methods:

1. Pay attention to daily life, regulate emotions, and avoid eating fatty and greasy foods.

Wood sound discussion (What are the Symptoms of Kidney Stones? What is Acute Renal Failure? Progressive decline, clinical syndrome appearing. Main manifestations are azotemia caused by a significant decrease in glomerular filtration rate, and water, electrolyte, and acid-base imbalance caused by renal tubular reabsorption and excretion dysfunction. Divided into oliguric (anuric) type and non-oliguric type. Belongs to the TCM categories of "strangury," "blockage and obstruction." [Clinical Manifestations] 1. Oliguric or Anuric Phase: Reduced urine volume, daily Generally lasts for 1-2 weeks; progressive azotemia, daily blood urea nitrogen rises by about 3.6-7.1mmol/L, blood creatinine rises by 44.2- 88.4umol/L; water, electrolyte disorder and acid-base imbalance, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia can be seen; cardiovascular system see hypertension, heart failure, arrhythmia. 2. Polyuric Phase: Progressive increase in urine volume, blood nitrogen level gradually decreases, lasting for about 1-3 weeks. 3. Recovery Phase: Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, urine volume gradually return to normal, glomerular filtration function mostly returns to normal within 3-12 months. [Treatment Methods] Western Medicine Treatment ＜1＞Oliguric Phase Bed rest, diet high in calories 8.4MJ/day, low protein 0.5g/kg, severe total parenteral nutrition.

Chapter Discussion What are the Causes of Trigeminal Neuralgia? This disease is a brief, recurrent severe pain that occurs in the distribution area of the trigeminal nerve. Divided into primary by inflammation, trauma, tumor, vascular disease, etc. caused. Traditional Chinese medicine calls this disease "migraine" "facial pain" [Clinical Manifestations] Primary trigeminal neuralgia is a sudden onset of severe pain, which is cutting-like, needle-like and paroxysmal. Each attack. Engaging in some actions involving the movement function of the trigeminal nerve (such as brushing teeth and chewing) or touching some trigger points in the area innervated by the trigeminal nerve can trigger the onset of pain. In severe cases, reflexive twitching of the facial muscles on the same side accompanies the attack. Remission period is normal. With disease progression, the remission period is increasingly shortened. Most symptoms are unilateral, and individual patients may have bilateral pain successively or simultaneously. Secondary trigeminal neuralgia is more common in young adults, and the location, nature, and trigger points of pain are the same as primary, but the pain is more persistent. [Treatment Methods] Secondary trigeminal neuralgia should be treated according to the primary cause. Primary treatment is mainly pain relief. ＜1＞Carbamazepine: is the first-line drug, initial dose 100mg, twice a day, increase 100mg daily after 1 day until pain is relieved.

Peripheral facial nerve palsy. Can occur at any age, its mechanism is related to acute non-suppurative inflammation of the facial nerve in the stylomastoid foramen. This disease belongs to the TCM categories of "stroke" "facial paralysis" etc. [Clinical Manifestations] Acute onset, pain in the ear or face on the same side may appear first, followed by facial muscle weakness, the latter can further develop into complete facial muscle paralysis. Paralysis side facial muscles are flat and relaxed, forehead wrinkles disappear, palpebral fissure widens, nasolabial fold becomes shallow, mouth corner and face deviate to the healthy side. Can be accompanied by drooling, tearing, taste loss or (and) hearing hypersensitivity, etc. Often recover spontaneously. If recovery is incomplete, muscle contracture, facial muscle spasm or synkinesis may occur. Contracture is manifested by palpebral fissure narrowing, nasolabial fold deepening, and mouth corner deviating to the affected side; facial muscle spasm is involuntary twitching of the facial muscles on the paralyzed side; synkinesis means involuntary muscle contractions when consciously making movements, such as involuntary closure of the eye on the affected side when showing teeth. [Treatment Methods] Prednisone, 30-60mg daily, may have a certain effect. Vitamin B1, vitamin B12, Dibazol etc. can be routinely used.

[Precautions] Pay special attention to avoiding catching cold, and other precautions can refer to the Chapter Discussion on Cerebral Thrombosis How is Cerebral Thrombosis Caused? This disease is caused by the narrowing or occlusion of the cerebral artery lumen due to the disease of the cerebral artery itself, or by the thrombus formed on the basis of the stenosis, resulting in local cerebral blood supply obstruction, causing cerebral softening and necrosis, including watershed infarction and lacunar infarction, collectively called cerebral infarction. Arteriosclerosis of cerebral arteries is the most common cause of cerebral thrombosis, and is often accompanied by hypertension. Cerebral thrombosis often occurs in parts such as the middle cerebral artery, the starting part of the internal carotid artery and the siphon part. This disease belongs to the TCM syndromes of "stroke" and "hemiplegia." Clinical Manifestations] Patients are mostly middle-aged and elderly, and may be accompanied History, some patients have a history of transient ischemic attack. 2. Cerebral thrombosis often occurs during quiet rest, and symptoms reach their peak after several hours or even 1-2 days. Usually conscious, vital signs are stable, when large-area cerebral infarction or severe basilar artery occlusion, there may be unconsciousness, or even brain herniation death. 3. Clinically, the condition reaches the highest level within 6 hours of onset Complete hemiplegia. Gradual progression of unilateral neurological dysfunction, called progressive type, usually symptoms still progress after 1-2 weeks, called slow progressive type, which is related to reduced cerebral perfusion, etc. Symptoms lasting for more than 24 hours and disappearing after a certain period of time are called reversible ischemic attacks, and the infarction is relatively mild. [Treatment Methods] Western Medicine Treatment ## ＜1＞Acute Phase General care: Bed rest, maintain airway patency. Intravenous infusion to maintain water and electrolyte balance and nutritional intake, nasogastric tube for those who cannot eat by themselves. Closely observe cardiopulmonary and renal function, prevent arrhythmia, heart failure, respiratory infections, and aspiration pneumonia, etc. Try to avoid glucose solution infusion, so as not to aggravate the damage of cerebral infarction due to hyperglycemia. Pay attention to prevent bedsore, keep bowel and urine unobstructed. Start passive activities as early as possible (especially paralyzed limbs), as well as respiratory exercises. Adjust blood pressure: Blood pressure in the acute phase of cerebral thrombosis patient Slightly higher level. If blood pressure is low, dopamine or other vasopressor drugs or fluid infusion should be given to raise blood pressure. Prevent cerebral edema: Used for severe condition with large infarction area, commonly 20% mannitol 125-250ml IV drip, 2-4 times a day, Use for 7-10 days. Closely monitor blood glucose and body temperature, and prevent complications. Thrombolytic therapy: Applicable to patients within 6 hours of onset and progressive stroke. However, CT must confirm no bleeding, patients have no bleeding tendency, and coagulation time, prothrombin time, etc. are measured. Such as urokinase, 10,000-20,000 units can be dissolved in 20ml of saline for intravenous injection, Once a day, 7-10 days for a course of treatment. Thrombolytic therapy can cause bleeding, and there is a problem of re-thrombosis after thrombolysis, so pay attention. Anticoagulant therapy: Applicable to progressive stroke, large-area cerebral infarction of the internal carotid artery system should not be used. Usually, heparin is intravenously dripped at a rate of 800-1200 units per hour to prolong activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) by 1-1.5 times. It can be changed to warfarin oral maintenance. Hemodilution therapy: Applicable to patients with high blood viscosity and cerebral infarction caused by hemodynamic factors, not applicable to arteriosclerotic cerebral infarction. Nimodipine: Can be used in the earliest stage of onset, Orally administered. Pay timely attention to whether there is a decrease in blood pressure and adjust it in time. Cerebral metabolic activators: such as adenosine triphosphate, Cytidine diphosphate choline, Cytochrome C, Coenzyme A, etc. can be routinely given (2) Recovery period treatment: There is a considerable period of brain dysfunction after stroke, so limb passive activity should be started as early as possible, and gradually increase active activity and various functional activities, and targeted rehabilitation exercises for brain dysfunction (speech, cognition, etc.) should be carried out. Based on the condition Progressively increase muscle strength, improve limb function, prevent complications such as joint contracture, and through sports therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, etc., emphasize the use of damaged limbs and achieve the goal of basic life self-care such as eating and dressing. Neurotrophic drugs (such as Cerebrolysin, etc.), antiplatelet aggregation drugs, etc. can also be taken to prevent recurrence. Chapter Discussion How to Prevent and Treat Cerebral Embolism? This disease is caused by various emboli entering the cerebral artery with blood flow, leading to blockage of blood flow, causing ischemia and necrosis of corresponding brain tissue, and corresponding neurological symptoms and signs. Clinically, cardiogenic emboli are the most common; non-cardiogenic emboli are also an important cause of cerebral embolism, such as atherosclerotic plaques and attachments of large vessels falling off, fat emboli from long bone fractures, parasite eggs, air emboli, etc. Embolism is more common in the internal carotid artery system (especially the middle cerebral artery), often causing vasospasm, and the lesion area is relatively large. Multiple episodes can occur, and hemorrhagic infarction is more common. This disease is equivalent to TCM "stroke" and "hemiplegia" syndromes. [Clinical Manifestations] The condition is sudden, develops rapidly, and symptoms reach their peak within seconds or minutes, mostly complete stroke. Symptoms manifest as hemiplegia, aphasia, hemianopia, hemisensory disorder, etc. or accompanied by transient consciousness disorder. Body symptoms depend on the neurological function of the blood supply area controlled by the embolic artery 2. In addition to brain lesions, there are also manifestations of primary diseases that serve as embolic sources. Such as cardiogenic diseases symptoms, such as. Fat embolism Mostly has pulmonary symptoms first, followed by mental abnormalities, irritability, chest pain and other neurological symptoms, mortality is higher. [Treatment Methods) ## 1. Western Medicine Treatment ＜1＞Treatment of brain lesions is basically the same as cerebral thrombosis, see "cerebral thrombosis" ＜2＞At the same time, it is necessary to treat the primary disease causing embolism to eliminate the source of emboli and prevent recurrence. Cardiogenic embolism should be treated with anticoagulation and antiplatelet aggregation therapy, but contraindicated for hemorrhagic infarction or those caused by acute bacterial endocarditis; In addition, intravenous drip should pay attention to the heart's bearing capacity. Anti-inflammatory treatment should be carried out for infectious embolism. 2.
