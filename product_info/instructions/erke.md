# Introduction to the Department of Pediatrics

## Main Subspecialties

- Neonatology
- Pediatric Internal Medicine
- Pediatric Surgery
- Pediatric Neurology
- Pediatric Cardiology

## Detailed Description of Each Department

### Neonatology

#### Introduction:
Neonatology specializes in the medical care, disease diagnosis, and treatment of newborns (within the first 28 days of life).

#### Services Provided:
- Neonatal health assessments
- High-risk neonatal monitoring
- Neonatal disease screening
- Intensive care for critically ill newborns

#### Diagnostic Process:
Neonatologists diagnose neonatal diseases by reviewing birth history and family history, performing physical examinations (e.g., weight, length, head circumference measurements, cardiopulmonary auscultation), and conducting necessary auxiliary tests such as blood tests, blood gas analysis, ultrasound, and X-rays.

#### Treatment Methods:
- Medication therapy
- Nutritional support
- Ventilator-assisted breathing
- Neonatal intensive care
- Surgical interventions (e.g., correction of congenital anomalies)

### Pediatric Internal Medicine

#### Introduction:
Pediatric Internal Medicine focuses on diagnosing and treating internal diseases in children aged 0â€“14 years.

#### Common Diseases:
- Respiratory infections
- Digestive diseases
- Nutritional disorders
- Hematologic diseases
- Kidney diseases
- Endocrine disorders

#### Diagnostic Process:
Pediatricians diagnose diseases through medical history inquiry, physical examination (e.g., cardiopulmonary auscultation, abdominal palpation), and necessary tests such as blood tests, urinalysis, biochemical tests, ECG, and ultrasound.

#### Treatment Methods:
- Medication therapy
- Nutritional support
- Psychological therapy (for anxiety, depression, etc.)
- Physical rehabilitation

### Pediatric Surgery

#### Introduction:
Pediatric Surgery specializes in the diagnosis, surgical treatment, and post-operative rehabilitation of pediatric surgical diseases.

#### Common Diseases:
- Congenital anomalies (e.g., congenital heart disease, cleft lip and palate)
- Trauma
- Tumors
- Infections

#### Diagnostic Process:
Pediatric surgeons diagnose diseases through medical history inquiry, physical examination (e.g., wound observation, mass palpation), and necessary imaging tests such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound.

#### Treatment Methods:
- Surgical treatment (e.g., tumor removal, congenital anomaly correction)
- Post-operative rehabilitation guidance
- Medication therapy

### Pediatric Neurology

#### Introduction:
Pediatric Neurology focuses on diagnosing and treating nervous system disorders in children.

#### Common Diseases:
- Epilepsy
- Cerebral palsy
- Autism
- ADHD
- Developmental delay
- Neurological infections

#### Diagnostic Process:
Pediatric neurologists diagnose diseases through medical history inquiry, physical examination (e.g., neurological examination, motor function assessment), and necessary auxiliary tests such as EEG, brain MRI, CT, and neuropsychological assessments.

#### Treatment Methods:
- Medication therapy
- Physical therapy
- Rehabilitation training
- Psychological therapy
- Neuromodulation therapy (e.g., deep brain stimulation)

### Pediatric Cardiology

#### Introduction:
Pediatric Cardiology specializes in diagnosing, treating, and following up on heart diseases in children.

#### Common Diseases:
- Congenital heart disease
- Myocarditis
- Arrhythmias
- Pericarditis
- Rheumatic heart disease

#### Diagnostic Process:
Pediatric cardiologists diagnose diseases through medical history inquiry, physical examination (e.g., cardiac auscultation, ECG), and necessary imaging tests such as echocardiography, cardiac CT, and MRI.

#### Treatment Methods:
- Medication therapy
- Cardiac surgery (e.g., congenital heart defect correction)
- Interventional treatment (e.g., device implantation)
- Cardiac rehabilitation guidance
