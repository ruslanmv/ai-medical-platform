## **AI-Medical Guidance Large Model**  

This is a project based on **InternLM**, designed to answer patients' questions.  

### **Project Overview:**  
This project aims to build an **intelligent self-service medical guidance platform**, specifically designed for patients who feel lost in the healthcare process. By integrating AI-assisted diagnosis, procedural guidance, medical examination result inquiries, medication guidance, and treatment plan introductions, the platform allows patients to navigate their entire hospital journey independently and efficientlyâ€”from admission to discharge. This reduces waiting time, enhances the medical experience, and achieves **convenient, transparent, and personalized** healthcare services.  

### **Core Features:**  
The project's primary objective is to develop a **highly integrated intelligent medical guidance system** using advanced **natural language processing (NLP) and speech recognition technologies**. This system enables **seamless interaction between patients and a virtual assistant**, allowing users to ask health-related questions, describe symptoms, and receive medical guidance through **voice or text input**.  

Powered by **deep learning algorithms**, the intelligent medical model **analyzes patient needs**, provides **accurate department recommendations**, and directs them to the most appropriate medical service units. This approach enhances **response speed, accuracy, and patient autonomy**, optimizing **resource allocation and medical service efficiency**.
